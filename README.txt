This is a Minecraft-like voxel game written in C++.

The end goal of this project is to create a survival game, inspired
mostly by Minecraft beta. The goal is not to copy Minecraft, but to
create a minimalist game that focuses on creativity, cool terrain gen
and the lonely sort of nature that Minecraft beta has.

I want the performance to remain much better than Minecraft's, which
allows massive render distances, enhancing the feeling of being in a
completely open world in which you can do whatever you want.

For this version, and all previous versions, the name Minecraft and the
textures from the official Minecraft game are being used as placeholders
until I come up with my own. I do not claim to have ownership of either
the name or the texture art.
