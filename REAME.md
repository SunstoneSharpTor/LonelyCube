This is a Minecraft-like voxel game written in C++.

The end goal of this project is to create a survival game, inspired
mostly by Minecraft beta. The goal is not to copy Minecraft, but to
create a minimalist game that focuses on creativity, cool terrain gen
and the lonely sort of nature that Minecraft beta has.

I want the performance to remain much better than Minecraft's, which
allows massive render distances, enhancing the feeling of being in a
completely open world in which you can do whatever you want.
